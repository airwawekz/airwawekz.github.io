Hello guys, today I will share my sad Bug Bounty hunting story .

Everything started when I read some BugÂ  Bounty articlesÂ  of the Yahoo giantÂ who inspired me to found this bug, among those articles were those of security researcherÂ Jouko PynnÃ¶nen.

He found two Stored Cross-Site Scripting bugs in mail.yahoo.com sub-domain and he got for every bug $10,000, that happend in 2015 &#8211; 2016.

I found same vulnerability type in same sub-domain and I got $2,000, it&#8217;s that correct?! ðŸ¤”Â I want to say that:Â I reported the bug when the Yahoo Bug Bounty action alone. At the momentÂ  Yahoo made a partnership with Oath.
