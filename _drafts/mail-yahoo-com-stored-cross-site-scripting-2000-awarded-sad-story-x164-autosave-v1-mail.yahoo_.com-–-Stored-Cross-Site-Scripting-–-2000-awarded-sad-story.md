Hello guys, today I will share my sad Bug Bounty hunting story.

Everything started when I read some BugÂ  Bounty articles of the Yahoo giantÂ who inspired me to found this bug, among those articles, were those of security researcherÂ Jouko PynnÃ¶nen.

He found two Stored Cross-Site Scripting bugs in mail.yahoo.com sub-domain and he got for every bug $10,000, that happened in 2015 &#8211; 2016.

I found same vulnerability type in the same sub-domain and I got $2,000, it&#8217;s that correct?! ðŸ¤”Â I want to say that:Â I reported the bug when the Yahoo Bug Bounty action alone. At the momentÂ  Yahoo made a partnership with Oath.

Ok, let&#8217;s see my proof of concept video, but first special thanks to Dan Cezar (another skilled guy ).

### #Description:

I bypassed the filter via HTML malformed tags in e-mail signature. The important thing: the XSS was active when the victim reply to the e-mail.

**Payload:**Â _&#8220;</a><img ismap=&#8217;xxx&#8217; itemtype=&#8217;yyy&#x27; style=width:100%;height:100%;position:fixed;left:0px;top:0px; onmouseover=alert(/XSS/)//&#8217;>_

### #Feedback: {#a384.graf.graf--h3.graf-after--p}

The progress and expectations of Yahoo&#8217;s Bug Bounty Program have not been great.

When can I give a note from 1 to 10, that can be 5.
